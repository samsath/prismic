## Python development kit for prismic.io

[![Latest Version](https://pypip.in/version/prismic/badge.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/prismic/)
[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/prismicio/python-kit.png)](https://travis-ci.org/prismicio/python-kit)

### Getting started

#### Install the kit for your project

Simply run:

```
pip install prismic
```

#### Get started with prismic.io

You can find out [how to get started with prismic.io](https://developers.prismic.io/documentation/UjBaQsuvzdIHvE4D/getting-started) on our [prismic.io developer's portal](https://developers.prismic.io/).

#### Get started using the kit

Also on our [prismic.io developer's portal](https://developers.prismic.io/), on top of our full documentation, you will:
 * get a thorough introduction of [how to use prismic.io kits](https://developers.prismic.io/documentation/UjBe8bGIJ3EKtgBZ/api-documentation#kits-and-helpers), including this one.
 * see [what else is available for Python](https://developers.prismic.io/technologies/UjBh78uvzeMJvE4o/python): starter projects, examples, ...


#### Kit's detailed documentation

You can find the documentation of the Python kit right here: http://prismic.readthedocs.org/en/latest/

Here is a basic example of use:
```python
>>> import prismic
>>> api = prismic.get("http://your-repo.prismic.io/api", "access_token")
>>> doc = api.get_by_uid("speculoos-macaron")
>>> doc.get_text("product.name")
u'Speculoos Macaron'
```

#### Using Memcached (or any other cache)

By default, the kit will use Shelve to cache the requests (a file-based cache from the standard library). It is recommended to use a cache server instead, for example Memcached.

You can pass a Memcached client to the `prismic.get` call:

```python
>>> import memcache
>>> api = prismic.get("http://your-lesbonneschoses.prismic.io/api", "access_token", memcache.Client(['127.0.0.1:11211']))
```

By duck typing you can pass any object that implement the `set` and `get` methods (see the `NoCache` object for the methods
to implement).

#### Using a Custom Request Handler

By default, the kit will use a request handler based on the popular package [requests](http://python-requests.org). If you, for some reason, wants to use a custom request handler,
 such as URLFetch (if you use Google AppEngine), for example. You can pass a function to the `prismic.get` call, this way:

 ```python
 >>> import prismic
 >>> import urllib2
 >>> def custom_request_handler(full_url):
 ...     r = urllib2.urlopen(full_url)
 ...     return r.getcode(), r.read(), r.info()
 ...
 >>> api = prismic.get("http://your-lesbonneschoses.prismic.io/api", "access_token", request_handler=custom_request_handler)
 ```

By duck typing you can pass any function that receives a URL and return a tuple containing status code, content and the headers of the response.
